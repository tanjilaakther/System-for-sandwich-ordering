# Sandwich ordering system

The system architecture includes a frontend application, two backed servers, a messaging broker, sandwich API for communication and database for data storage.  For frontend application React JS framework has been used. For backend, servers are developed using NodeJS. RabbitMQ has been used as messaging broker to maintain the order request.  MongoDB database has been used for storing sandwich request data and to check order status. In frontend, user gets a list of sandwiches with details related to sandwich order. Users order sandwich with order option and gets order ID. Order ID can be used by the user later to check the order status. The communication between the frontend application and backend server is maintained by Sandwich API. Server A receives tasks from frontend using the API and order information is saved by the Server A to the database and sends order information to RabbitMQ for queueing. Server A also gets the order status if ready or not from server B and saves the status to database. Server B receives the order from RabbitMQ and sends notification of “order ready” to RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ is responsible for maintaining the task queue for both servers.
